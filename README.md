# Kuromi-Multitool
Kuromi is a currently in Beta script to clean, desinfect and manage your system, all with just a CMD tool and keeping it simple.

I created Kuromi as a fun project because I was tired of having to download and do a bunch of things every time I reinstalled Windows. Also, for some reason, my teacher wanted us to learn .bat scripting, which gave me another reason to work on it. The objective of Kuromi is to simplify tedious processes and make them easier and more simple.
I decided to make it a .bat file because it seemed like the simplest and most accessible option for anyone who wants to modify it. If you check the README file that comes with the script, you'll see that I left clear instructions for people who want to use certain parts of the script without needing to run everything it does. This way, you can customize it to your needs without any problem.

The script makes use of third-party software like caffeine to keep your PC up while performing tasks that take a while.

PLEASE CHECK THE README INCLUDED WITH THE SCRIPT FOR THE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION!!!

And yes, the name comes from the Sanrio charcter, i like her.

# FaQ

## Is Kuromi safe?/Not a virus?

- Why would it be? Kuromi is completely open source, which means everyone can see how the app works. If it had anything strange, it wouldn’t be open source since that would expose its real purpose.

  ## Why does my antivirus detect Kuromi as a virus?
- Some antivirus programs may flag scripts like Kuromi as false positives. This is common with tools that interact with system files or perform cleaning tasks. If this happens, you can temporarily disable your antivirus while using Kuromi. This can happen with other reputable tools like "Medicat" ffor example.

## Why is Kuromi a .bat instead of having a proper source code and a UI?

- Kuromi started as a fun project and as a way for me to study .bat scripting because my teacher asked us to (I guess lawmakers didn’t think of a better thing for us to learn). One of Kuromi’s objectives is also to be lightweight. Making it a .bat not only achieves that, but also gives me more opportunities to create better commands, since it’s like putting commands directly into a CMD console.
